## INTRODUCTION
Like Everyone, as a Blackberry App developer , most of the time we used to spend in porting App for different RIM OS/Devices (Thanks to Blackberry Device Fragmentation issue :) ).

With the Traditional Approach , We had the below problems and and these consumes a lot of productive time .

1. Building App for different OS

2. Installing and Deploying to different RIM device

3. Problem with Images - Either scale the Images on runtime or manage different set of images for different screen resolutions.

The Framework is a step to Automate the Build process and make your life easier by using the ANT Build scripting.

See the WIKI Pages for more details.

Planned Features
Continuous Integration (CI)
Automated Unit Testing
Hope this project is useful to you and feel free to ask your query and for new feature request.

Cee U Later :)
